I built a functional Real-Time Chat Application using the MERN stack. This project focused on enabling instantaneous communication between users through a clean and responsive interface.

- Scalable Backend: Developed a robust server using Node.js and Express to manage active connections.

- Dynamic UI: Built a responsive frontend using React.js, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices.

- State Management: Utilized React hooks to manage message history and user presence in real-time."
